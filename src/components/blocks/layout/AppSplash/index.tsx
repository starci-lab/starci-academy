/**
 * AppSplash — the full-screen entry "suspense" screen shown the moment you land
 * on the app (cold load / hard refresh): the StarCi lockup centred over the page
 * background, with the same 3px brand-pink line trickling across the top as
 * {@link TopLoader} (one accent bar, two surfaces).
 *
 * It paints in the server HTML (so it's there before any JS), then fades out once
 * the client has mounted — plus a short minimum so it doesn't blink on a fast
 * boot. Self-managing: mounted once in {@link InnerLayout}, renders `null` when
 * done. (A self-dismissing overlay inside the providers is used rather than a raw
 * `<Suspense fallback>` so it inherits the theme class and never re-shows on
 * client navigation — that's the {@link TopLoader} bar's job.) Honours
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` (static bar, no trickle). Owns all of its style.
