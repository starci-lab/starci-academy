/**
 * Mount point for SWR queries that have no direct component consumer but must run
 * app-wide for their side effect (hydrating Redux as the route/auth state changes).
 *
 * Previously these queries ran because they were mounted inside `SwrProvider` (now removed). This
 * component replaces that WITHOUT a context: it renders `null` (no children), so when a query
 * changes state only this component re-renders, NOT the whole app tree (unlike the old mega-context
 * that re-rendered all 57 consumers). Queries that already have a real consumer run there instead.
 * @returns `null` — only runs the hooks for their side effects.
